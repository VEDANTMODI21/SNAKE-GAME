# SNAKE-GAME
The Snake Game in C++ is a simple console-based game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. It uses basic C++ concepts like loops, conditionals, and real-time input handling, making it a fun project to learn game logic and basic game development.
